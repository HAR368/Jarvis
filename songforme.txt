 Hello Deva Raj, I'd be happy to write a song for you! Here's a short and simple song that I came up with:

(Verse 1)
In the morning, as the sun begins to rise,
I take a deep breath and open my eyes.
I think of all the things I want to do,
The dreams I have, and the people I love too.

(Chorus)
I'm alive, and I'm grateful for each day,
For the beauty of this world, and the chance to play.
I'll make the most of every moment I have,
And live my life with joy, and laugh and laugh.

(Verse 2)
As I go through my day, I'll try to be kind,
To help others and make peace of mind.
I'll work hard and strive for my goals,
But I'll also take time to rest my soul.

(Chorus)
I'm alive, and I'm grateful for each day,
For the beauty of this world, and the chance to play.
I'll make the most of every moment I have,
And live my life with joy, and laugh and laugh.

(Bridge)
Sometimes I'll stumble, and sometimes I'll fall,
But I'll pick myself up, and I won't let it all
Bring me down, because I know that I'm strong,
And I'll keep singing this song.

(Chorus)
I'm alive, and I'm grateful for each day,
For the beauty of this world, and the chance to play.
I'll make the most of every moment I have,
And live my life with joy, and laugh and laugh.

(Outro)
I'm alive, and I'm grateful for each day,
For the beauty of this world, and the chance to play.
I'll make the most of every moment I have,
And live my life with joy, and laugh and laugh.

I hope you enjoy this song, Deva Raj! Let me know if you have any other requests.
